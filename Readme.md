# MC-Ubes, Simple Marching Cubes implementation

See (demo)[http://learntocode.biz/mc-ubes/]

Features:

 * Uses Unity
 * Heavily influenced by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7yyZZjF1z4&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eZgMK_DT5_biRkWXftAOf9) though this is a complete re-write to fit my style
 * Not very useful in it's current implementation, but it's got potential
